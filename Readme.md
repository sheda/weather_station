# Picture Frame - Weather Stations (by Sheda 2016)
This project is covered by Licenc GPL v2.0

This weather station connect to yahoo weather forecast throught wifi connection and display the forecast for a setted city through given WOEID.
The weather forecast is displayed through 6 pictograms (storm, snow, rain, wind, cloud, sun) driven with a servo motor.
This also has got a poke function working through MQTT protocol using a broker.
So this rely on a public third party external service that may experience unexpected outage.

1 - Setting Mode:
=================
The setting mode is  entered if switch is on position "SET" before **Switching On** the Weather Station. The wifi icon is shown on the wheel and LED is stand still on.

This will create a wifi hotspot:
 * SSID: "SHEDA_CFG"
 * PSWD: 12345678

Once connected you will get IP "192.168.4.2".

### Setting instruction:
This server allow you to set SSID, PASSWORD of your internet connection, and the WOEID. 
 * Set the switch to "SET" position
 * Plug the power supply
 * On your device connect to WIFI "SHEDA_CFG" with password "12345678"
 * Open a web browser and connect to "http://192.168.4.1"
 * Enter the ssid and password of your __house's wifi__ with internet connection.
 * Go to "http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/", to get your WOEID (for Paris woeid is 615702) and copy it in the right field
 * Click Submit
 * Power off the WeatherStation
 * And set the switch to "WEATHER" position

2 - Normal WeatherMode:
================

The weather Mode is the main behaviour of the WeatherStation, it use previously setted credential to connect WIFI with internet connection.

### Main behaviour:
It will boot and display wifi icon until wifi connection if ok. Next, it fetches each 3 minutes the yahoo's weather forcast and display the result on the wheel.

### Poke behaviour:
Your friends can poke you on throught using MQTT client. This rely on a broker that may experience unexpected outage. The displayed poke last until the weather is refreshed.

**Client on android:**
* [MyMQTT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.tripwire.mqtt.client&hl=en)

**Settings:**
* Open the App
* Enter the the broker address, port 1883(default)
* Publish on the channel "/sheda/<your_id>/poke" with message payload or not it doesn't matter

3 - Electronic Board:
=====================

The pin header on the right of the board (switch is on the left) is separated as follow from top to bottom:

**Servo:**
* 1 : GND  (brown wire)
* 2 : 3.3V (red wire)
* 3 : DATA (yellow wire)

**UART 3v3 (9600N1):**

**/!\ Beware of using TTL uart it may destroy the esp8266, use "voltage divisor bridge" before the pin 4**
* 4: RX (connect TX of your UART adapter) 
* 5: TX (connect RX of your uart adapter)
* 6: GND (connect GND of your uart adapter)

**Power Supply(DC 5v-15v max):**
* 7: VCC (connect AC-DC adapter +)
* 8: GND (connect AC-DC adapter -)

**/!\ The AC-DC came with 3pins, the one not connected should be outside the board and **NOT** connected on pin 6**
**/!\ The Power regulator may be **HOT** according to workload should not touch it.**
